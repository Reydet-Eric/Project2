<h1>Fruits and Vegetables of Summer:</h1>
<p>You know summer's the perfect time to switch to flip-flops, but did you know it's also the right time to change your diet? Being outdoors more often – and sweating – ups your risk for health problems such as dehydration, skin sensitivities, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies. The simple (and delicious) solution? Eat local, in-season fruits. Their nutrients are at their peak in the summer.</p>
